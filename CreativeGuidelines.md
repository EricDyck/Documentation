#Tap for Tap - Creative Guidelines

## Ad Units

To learn more about what kind of banners you can make and how the banners are displayed, check out our [ad units](/documentation/AdUnits) documentation.

## Performance

Getting the best performance from your banners is very important. If you achieve a higher TTR (tap through rate) and CR (conversion rate) your banner will waste less valuable impressions.  This might not seem like a good idea since less people see your banner for every tap generated, but it will result in better banners being displayed on your app, and resulting in a lot more tap credits. With Tap for Tap you receive the same value you send.

## Generated Banners

Don’t have banners for your app? You can create great looking banners with our banner generation system. No profanities allowed! Note: This is required before being able to add custom banners.

## Line 1 - One Sentence

You have one sentence to convey a strong message on what your app is about. Use actionable words if possible like “create ringtones” or “play now”. Note: This is limited to **32** characters.

## Line 2 - App Name

Let people know the name of your apop, limited to **20** characters.

## App Price

The price of your app will automatically be placed in the banner for you.

## Description

Here you have more room to more accurately describe your app.  Pitch your app to potential users as quick as possible.  This will be placed on the pitch page ad unit, and potentially will greatly increase your conversion rate. Note: This is limited to **250** characters.

## Custom Banners

You can upload custom banners to maintain branding from start to finish.  If your banner is well designed it can radically improve your overall performance. We strongly recommend you show your app’s icon somewhere on the banner.

## Coming Soon

In early 2013 you will be able to upload multiple custom banners and weight them.  This will enable you to optimize which banner performs best and test new ideas.  We are also allowing language specific banners so you can reach a larger audience.

## Ad Placement

If you have questions about how to best place Tap for Tap ads for best performance check out our [ad placement guide](/documentation/AdPlacementGuide).
