# Getting Started with Tap for Tap #

Get users and make money by integrating the Tap for Tap SDK.  This guide will explain the setup process from start to finish.

##  Account Setup

Tap for Tap allows you to do a mix of growing your app's userbase for free with our [Tap Exchange](TapExchange) or make money with [Monetization](Monetization). You can set it at any time when logged into your Tap for Tap developer account:

If you want to focus your traffic on our tap exchange, move the slider more to the left.  If you want to make more money move the slider more to the right.

##  Download SDK

Download our SDK [here](https://github.com/tapfortap/Documentation/zipball/master).  If you are using one of our supported plugins (Unity 3D, Phonegap, etc.), download the appropriate SDK package for the corresponding plugin [here](). Please familiarize yourself with the .ZIP file contents.

##  SDK Implementation

Follow our documentation step-by-step for [Android](Android) or [iOS](iOS). You will need to obtain your account-wide API Key used by our SDK. You can find it on the top of your account page. If you are using one of our supported plugins, please use the documentation for that specific plugin. For additional help, you can follow our SDK implementation videos for [Android](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDj16PJ5WQk&hd=1) and [iOS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS7DEvITf7Y&hd=1).

##  Trigger Initialize

Once the Tap for Tap SDK is installed, please open your app.  When you check-in with initialize, you should get an alert message notifying you that your SDK installation was successful and your app has been created on Tap for Tap. You will only receive this alert once per app.

##  Place Ad Units (Optional)

If you wish to generate traffic for tap credits or revenue with an app, place [ad units](AdUnits) in your app to generate community and/or revenue traffic. If you only wish to promote this app on our [Tap Exchange](TapExchange) or [Paid Promotion](PaidPromotion) you might not wish to place ads.

##  Log In to Tap for Tap

Now that your app is on [Tap for Tap](http://tapfortap.com), it will need to be configured so you can promote it on the network, [Login Here](http://tapfortap.com/login)

##  The App Market

Your app MUST be live and on the corresponding app market before it can be properly configured. Once on the market (**Apple App Store** or **Google Play**), you should create promotion banners. If your app was originally added to Tap for Tap before being placed on the app market, you should use the refresh button on the app’s overview page to grab the information necessary for configuration.

##  Create Banner Creatives

You need to add creatives for your app so they can start being promoted.  First, you must create banners using the banner generation system. We will collect some “creative” information from you in order to generate all ad units for you so you can promote your app successfully.  Optionally, you can upload your own images if you wish to customize the look of your banner creatives.

##  Start Promoting on the Tap Exchange (Optional)

Once properly configured, you will be able to earn tap credits with the [Tap Exchange](TapExchange) for promoting community apps.  Your tap credits will automatically spend the same value as you earn.  If you have multiple apps, you can prioritize how much promotion each app spends by adjusting the “spend priority” setting under each app.

##  Make Money (Optional)

You can set your app to display both tap exchange ads AND revenue-generating ads.  You can prioritize the ratio of revenue-generating ads to tap exchange ads on the developer interface. When making money with our [Monetization Program](Monetization) we will increment your balance when it makes money. Every month you will have the opportunity to cash our, or you can chose to spend that money on our [Paid Promotion Program](PaidPromotion).

##  Paid Promotion (Optional)

You can add money to your account balance, or earn money with our [Monetization Program](Monetization) to buy more promotion for your app.  You have three ways to buy traffic based on what is important to you:

1. Banner Creative Impression
2. Banner Creative Tap
3. App User Installation

[Paid Promotion](PaidPromotion) allows you to grow your apps userbase much faster.
